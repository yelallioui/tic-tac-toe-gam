A classic Tic-Tac-Toe (or Noughts and Crosses) game built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This project is a simple, interactive web application where two players can compete against each other on the same screen.

## Features

-   **Interactive UI**: Clean and simple interface to play the game.
-   **Player Turns**: The game alternates between 'X' and 'O' players.
-   **Win Detection**: The application automatically detects when a player gets three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
-   **Draw Detection**: If all cells are filled and no one has won, the game declares a draw.
-   **Restart Game**: A button to instantly reset the board and start a new game.
-   **Hover Indicator**: Shows which player's turn it is by hovering their mark ('X' or 'O') over empty cells.

## How to Play

1.  The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2.  Player 1 is 'X' and Player 2 is 'O'.
3.  Players take turns clicking on an empty cell to place their mark.
4.  The first player to get three of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
5.  If all 9 cells are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
6.  Click the "Restart" button to play again.
